# elm-pages-starter-fastify
This is an example of using [elm-pages](https://elm-pages.com) with [Fastify](https://fastify.dev).

You can see it running at https://elm-pages-v3-fastify.fly.dev/

See the discussion on elm-pages adapters at <https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages/discussions/378>

## Fastify Adapter for elm-pages
The Fastify adapter is located in `adapters/fastify/adapter.mjs` plays an important role during the build process. It combines the `elm-pages` renderer, Fastify plugin, and server components, placing them into the `dist-server/` directory. You can find detailed information about `elm-pages` adapters at https://elm-pages.com/docs/adapters/.

After `npm run build`, the adapter will have generated the following files:

- `dist-server/server.mjs` - a node Fastify server configured for elm-pages.
This can be run directly with `node dist-server/server.mjs`.
This repo is set up to do that via `npm start`.

- `dist-server/plugin.mjs` exports a default function that can be used to serve the elm-pages app via [Fastify Plugin](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Plugins/). You can use this to integrate into your existing Fastify service, or if the generated server doesn't work for your needs.

**Note:** Any routes you don't want by elm-pages must come _before_ this plugin. You will also need to point [Fastify static middleware](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-static) at `dist`.

## Setup Instructions

You can clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/shahnhogan/elm-pages-starter-fastify.git`.

`npm install` from the cloned repo. Before running the dev server or build, make sure to install Lamdera (see below).

`npm run dev` starts the dev server with hot reloading.

`npm run build` builds the app for production.

`npm start` starts the production server at `server.mjs`.

### Deployment
This example is deployed to Fly.io, but can run anywhere that can serve a node app.

[Deploy your own with these instructions.](https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/node/)

Note: the default `Dockerfile` generated by flyctl will need some additions for elm-tooling and lamdera. You can use the one in this repo directly or as a reference.

### Install Lamdera

[Install Lamdera with these instructions](https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs/download).

`elm-pages` 3.0 uses the lamdera compiler, which is a superset of the Elm compiler with some extra functionality to automatically serialize Elm types to Bytes.

### Debugging Lamdera Errors

Sometimes Lamdera will give compiler errors due to corrupted dependency cache. These messages will display a note at the bottom:

```
-- PROBLEM BUILDING DEPENDENCIES ---------------

...


Note: Sometimes `lamdera reset` can fix this problem by rebuilding caches, so
give that a try first.
```

Be sure to use `lamdera reset` to reset the caches for these cases. See more info about that in the Lamdera docs: https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs/ides-and-tooling#problem-corrupt-caches

### Docs

Check out [the Package Docs](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-pages/latest/). You can also use `npx elm-pages docs` from your project to view the documentation for the `RouteBuilder` module.

## Running Scripts with `elm-pages run`

- `npm install`
- `npx elm-pages run script/src/AddRoute.elm User.Id_` - now you can try out the generator! And you can tweak it, or even define new generator modules in the `script/` folder! You can also shorten this command to `npx elm-pages run AddRoute User.Id_` if you prefer.


## Thank You & Inspiration

Thank you to [dillonkearns](https://github.com/dillonkearns) for [elm-pages](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages)! Thank you [blaix](https://github.com/blaix) as this adapter was heavily inspired by @blaix and his [elm-pages-starter-express](https://github.com/blaix/elm-pages-starter-express) project!
